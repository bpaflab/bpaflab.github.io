<h2>Ambulatory blood pressure measurement</h2>
<blockquote>Providing information toward diagnosis of hypertension (high blood pressure) and it's subtypes, or effectiveness of antihypertensive medication over 24 hours.</blockquote>
<p>A comprehensive assessment of blood pressure when you visit us in the clinic, and more importantly, when you are living your normal life outside of the clinic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>blood pressure differences between arms</li>
  <li>resting in-clinic blood pressure (for standardised comparison to out-of-clinic blood pressure)</li>
  <li>24 hour brachial (upper arm) blood pressure</li>
  <li>calculated aortic blood pressure in-clinic and out-of-clinic</li>
  <li>measures of arterial stiffness</li>
</ul>
<p>We integrate measures from multiple devices in a single, succinct, graphical and clearly communicated patient report.</p>
<h2>Autonomic function measurement</h2>
<blockquote>Taking the time to get it right.</blockquote>
<p>Autonomic function is a difficult parameter to quantify. At the BPVF Laboratory we take the time with every patient to achieve the best results we can. We apply a suite of tests with an emphasise on autonomic control of the heart and blood vessels, useful for informing diagnosis of such conditions as orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic tachycardia.</p>
