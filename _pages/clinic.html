<p>We operate within the MQ Health Cardiology Clinic. If you are interested in getting a blood pressure or autonomic function test, you will need your treating doctor to make a referral to <a href="https://www.mqhealth.org.au/services/find-a-service/cardiology-clinic">MQ Health Cardiology Clinic.</a></p>
<h2>Ambulatory blood pressure measurement</h2>
<blockquote>Providing information toward diagnosis of hypertension (high blood pressure) and its subtypes, or effectiveness of antihypertensive medication over 24 hours.</blockquote>
<p>A comprehensive assessment of blood pressure when you visit us in the clinic, and more importantly, when you are living your normal life outside of the clinic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>blood pressure differences between arms</li>
  <li>resting in-clinic blood pressure (for standardised comparison to out-of-clinic blood pressure)</li>
  <li>24 hour brachial (upper arm) blood pressure</li>
  <li>calculated aortic blood pressure in-clinic and out-of-clinic</li>
  <li>measures of arterial stiffness</li>
</ul>
<p>We integrate measures from multiple devices in a single, succinct, graphical and clearly communicated patient report.</p>
<h2>Autonomic function measurement</h2>
<blockquote>Taking the time to get it right.</blockquote>
<p>Autonomic function is a difficult parameter to quantify. At the BPVF Laboratory we take the time with every patient to achieve the best results we can. We apply a suite of tests with an emphasis on autonomic control of the heart and blood vessels, useful for informing diagnosis of such conditions as orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure on standing) or orthostatic tachycardia (a racing heart when standing).</p>
